## Introduction
The goal of this project was to be able to contribute code to an partially constructed object-oriented application, follow spec/prompts to make a working application, implement ES6 classes, write modular, reusable code that follows SRP, and implement a robust testing suite using TDD

## Features

- At the end of the quiz, users are given a score of their result. 
- At the end of the quiz, users are given the minutes and seconds it took for them to complete the quiz

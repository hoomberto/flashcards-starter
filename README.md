## Introduction
The goal of this project was to be able to contribute code to an partially constructed object-oriented application, follow spec/prompts to make a working application, implement ES6 classes, write modular, reusable code that follows SRP, and implement a robust testing suite using TDD

## Features
- Users can run through a quiz featuring questions relating to prototype array methods
- At the end of the quiz, users are given a score of their result. 

Fully playable rock paper scissors in which the user and computer choices are shown beneath what they pick

### Future Additions
- Add timer functionality so that the quiz displays how long it took to complete
- Have the quiz restart if the user's score is less than 90 percent
